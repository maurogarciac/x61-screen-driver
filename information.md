I don't know enough to finish this project by myself, so I expect having to learn some new things.  
This is a list of all the things I need to learn to complete this project:  
1. How to progam FPGAs, or some sort of fast processor for images, not sure about that exactly
    - There's a couple books I could read, will start probably with 'FPGA Prototyping by Verilog'
    - Could be a timesink
2. How LVDS protocol works, and how to implement it on the processor.
    - For this one, not particularly sure. 
    - The wikipedia article explains some things, but will probably branch out into smaller topics I'm not familiar with.
    - Risky timesink
3. How to make a board with HDMI output, and what the standard for that is.
    - I don't think this one will be too complex.
    - Highly depentant on FPGA point
    - Found this with 2 mins of googling, not useful for my case but it's good to put yourself in context with the problem: https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/215661
4. How to power the board, assuming LED mod was done on the screen.

  
Extra information:  
1. What's the pinnout for x61 battery, and how to you charge/discharge it?
    - This could be useful idk: https://youtu.be/zae3Yt-eQXY
2.
