# x61-screen-driver

The idea is to build a display driver to make the screen output to HDMI, since the ones on aliexpress/ebay are bulky and don't specify compatibility with this screen.

## Information:

There are some documents that specify some infomation on the display itself and how it comunicates

So far that's all I got, and some wikipedia articles:

[LVDS Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-voltage_differential_signaling)
